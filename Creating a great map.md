# How to Create a Great Map

## Abstract:
This document explains the theory behind good and unique game plays, as well as common pitfall of new maps

## 1. Great Gameplay
Inorder to make a great map, it not only needs to be beautiful (Ugly maps do exists), but fun to play. The best maps should allow multiple different strategies to work, well forcing players to change there strategies, to new ones, in order to constantly win. If the same stratigy works for every map, whichever player perfects it, will always win, making the game less fun.
#### Common strategies:
<b>Mostly neutral maps</b>
* Begin with heavy growth into neutral planets
* Attack the other player intimidate, while they are weak from growth

<b>Mostly colored maps</b>
* Wait for other players in a 3+ player game to fight and become weak
* Gather planets in one place, and launch attacks
