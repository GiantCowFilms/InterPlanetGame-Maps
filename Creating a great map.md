# How to Create a Great Map

## Abstract:
This document explains the theory behind good and unique game plays, as well as common pitfall of new maps

## 1. Great Gameplay
In order to make a great map, it not only needs to be beautiful (Ugly maps do exists), but fun to play. The best maps should allow multiple different strategies to work, well forcing players to change there strategies, to new ones, in order to constantly win. If the same strategy works for every map, whichever player perfects it, will always win, making the game less fun.
#### Common strategies:
<b>Mostly neutral maps</b>
* Begin with heavy growth into neutral planets
* Attack the other player immediately, while they are weak from growth

<b>Mostly colored maps</b>
* Wait for other players in a 3+ player game to fight and become weak
* Gather troops on one planet, and launch attacks

These are common strategies, that have been observed to work in the past, and are quite popular. The first thing to note is there simplicity. Complex variants of these concepts do abound, but there is very little through game strategizing other than theses moves, new and interesting maps will change that, achieving __Great Gamplay__.

#### Avoiding Strategies:
To build a unique map, there are 2 approaches:

1. Build a map to avoid the effectiveness of a common strategy
2. Build a map to favor a certain set of actions

Example(s) of __#1__

1. In 3+ player maps, a common strategy is to wait for ther other players to fight and weaken each other before attacking. This works in maps that are short of nuetral planets, since sitting and waiting while opponents gather major growth will result in falling behind, even if they do become weakened thorough conflict.

1. Another strategy was to attack the player when they are week from growth into neutral planets. There are 2 way to avoid this. One is to put a "divide" between the players, so that if a player directly attacks the other when they are expanding to new planets, by the time they get there, the other player will have generated enought troops to handel an attack. The second solution is to make some of the neutral planets very weak, so they return the troops lost to gain them, quickly.



This is still a WIP.
